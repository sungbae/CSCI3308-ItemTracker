This repo is just going to be about the default project for
csci3308

----------------------------------------------------------------

Repo Organization:

The OLD directory is to hold original html/php/java files for the site, but we never use them. These files are just for reference.

The html directory is the main and only directory we use for our website.

test_cases are required for csci3308 submission.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Main code for the CSCI3308-ItemTracker:

All the code used on the site is found in the html directory. Here you will find css/images which are used for the design of the webpages. We use homepage.html for the first page of our website. The second page (after hitting login) will direct the user to page1new.html. This file will recall to the three files (changePeopleNew.php, searchItemsNew.php, searchPeopleNew.php) in search/ben_search directory. We use the signup.php file in html which is recalled by homepage.html if the user hits "join us".

These functionality of the code can be done through the website which is given in the submission for project part 6.
